# Pong
I followed a tutorial to make this, learnt lots from it- good practice.
The tutorial was not 100% perfect, so I had to make some changes on the fly. A couple changes I had to make I got some help from a friend- mainly in the ball class
which was randomising which direction the ball goes when it hits a paddle- I wasn't 100% sure and had to ask a question about 1 or 2 lines of code.
